# Technology-Hundred-Day-Plan
Here is my CIO/CTO on-boarding plan for your first 100 days in a new assignment. 

Technology is constantly evolving to meet the needs of both individuals and business consumers. The good news is there are typically patterns that appear as this cycle of change repeats. The key is to see the patterns and respond accordingly.  

Technology Management attempts to apply classic methods of planning and organization to this disciple of technology. The result is processes, projects, timelines, and deliverables that direct and drive the most successful engineering and IT operations teams.

Technology Leadership focuses on the people as individuals working together in teams. The goal is to inspire these individuals to become "high performing teams" delivering superior results year after year. This website presents topics related to both IT management and leadership in the context of real world projects and teams.
